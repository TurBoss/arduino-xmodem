# arduino-xmodem

Goodle code has been closed for some time, I just decided to finally move 
my stuff to GitHib. I guess I am late by a few years, but still it is 
better to do it later, rather than never.

XMODEM is well known, a little bit old, but still working protocol for 
data transfer over serial connection.I started this project because 
I needed to transfer some binary files from a PC to Arduino compatible board. 
I could not manage to find any existing solution and decided to provide 
simple XMODEM implementation. This implementation is done from scratch and is coded in C++.
